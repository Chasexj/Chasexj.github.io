## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Nick Feamster. I also received my B.S. in both Computer Science and Economic from Colgate Unversity, advised by Prof. Aaron Gember Jacobson. My research focuses on synthetic data generation, ML-driven network traffic modeling, and real-time data systems. I have published in top-tier venues including SIGMETRICS, KDD, WWW, and CoNEXT.

Beyond research, I am an entrepreneur and co-founder of multiple startups.
